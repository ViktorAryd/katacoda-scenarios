This is a tutorial for setting up a Firecracker microVM service locally and to communicate with that using some of the functions in the included API.  

Firecracker is an open source technology for creating and managing small and secure virtual machines (microVM's) intended for serverless computing. It enables deployment of workloads with increased security and isolation as compared to traditional virtual machines with very fast load times. Firecracker starts up a virtual machine and initiates a workload in as little as 125 ms and supports creation rates of up to 150 virtual machines per second. 
With the use of Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) the microVM's are created and run in user space offering a virtual machine barrier separation of every workload. All non-essential functionality has also been reduced resulting in a reduced attack surface of the microVM.
